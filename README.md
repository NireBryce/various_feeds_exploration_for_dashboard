Exploring various APIs to eventualy bring into a dashboard.  

- Weather api
  - [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/)  
- bus tracking and transit api  
- map api  

then impliment tests for them once I have the MVP working and can play around, and then build a better app around those tests.  

stretch goals:  

- todo app  
- schedule app that uses calendar data  
- eventually combine all of these into one TUI  

the goal is to convert these to `textual` to learn about python TUIs, and then convert them from `textual` to `rataTUI` as a rust learning exercise
